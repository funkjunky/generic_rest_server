This is a generic REST server that will give and take any information thrown at it. I've built it strictly for testing when you don't yet have access to the API you plan on using.

INSTALLATION: git clone <url>, then npm install

use the restconfig.json file in the root folder to configure the settings through JSON.
The settings you can set are "port" and "database". Port in an integer, while database is a string.
Also you can set the settings from the command, the operational command is:
node server.js [mongo_url] [database] [port]

The urls are all "/:collection" with the data determining what to create, change or query. In the case of a "PUT" edit, the _id will be used to edit it.

You can add files by "PUT"ing to "/__file/:folder" and returned will be the object:
{url: <url path of file>, type: <type of file>}
